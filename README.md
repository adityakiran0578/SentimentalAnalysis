## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the IMDb Movie Reviews dataset, which contains 50,000 movie reviews labeled as either positive or negative.

## Data Preprocessing
Loading the dataset: The dataset is loaded and split into training and testing sets.\
Cleaning the reviews: Special characters, numbers, and other non-alphabetic characters are removed from the reviews.\
Label encoding: Sentiment labels are converted to numerical values: positive (1) and negative (0).\
## Word Embedding
Import GloVe Word Embedding: The GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation) embeddings are used to build the embedding dictionary.\
Embedding Matrix: An embedding matrix is constructed for the words in our corpus using the GloVe vectors.\
## Model Training
Three different models are trained using Keras to perform sentiment analysis:\

### Simple Neural Network
A basic neural network model with an embedding layer followed by dense layers.

### Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
A CNN model is used to capture local features in the text data, utilizing convolutional layers.

### Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
An LSTM model is trained to capture long-term dependencies in the text data, making use of LSTM layers.

## Evaluation
The performance of each model is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the test dataset.

## Predictions
The best performing model is used to perform predictions on new, real IMDb movie reviews.
